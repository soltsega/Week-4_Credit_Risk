# 💳 Credit Risk Scoring Challenge: Buy-Now-Pay-Later Implementation

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

This project is part of the 10 Academy AI Mastery Week 4 Challenge, focusing on building an end-to-end credit risk model for Bati Bank's new buy-now-pay-later service. The challenge requires transforming eCommerce transaction data into actionable credit risk insights.

## 🏦 Business Context

Bati Bank is partnering with a successful eCommerce platform to offer flexible payment options. Your task is to develop a credit scoring system that evaluates customer creditworthiness using alternative data sources, specifically transaction history from the eCommerce platform.

## 🎯 Core Challenge Components

### 1\. Proxy Variable Definition

**Challenge**: The dataset lacks direct credit default labels.
**Solution Required**:

  * Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
  * Use K-Means clustering to segment customers
  * Create a binary `is_high_risk` label (1 = high risk, 0 = low risk)
  * Justify your clustering approach and risk threshold

### 2\. Feature Engineering

**Challenge**: Transform raw transaction data into meaningful predictors.
**Required Features**:

  * Transaction patterns (time-based, amount distributions)
  * Customer behavior metrics
  * Product category preferences
  * Channel usage patterns
  * Implement Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) transformations

### 3\. Model Development

**Challenge**: Build a model that accurately predicts credit risk.
**Requirements**:

  * Implement at least two different algorithms
  * Include hyperparameter tuning
  * Handle class imbalance if present
  * Document model selection rationale

### 4\. Risk Probability & Credit Scoring

**Challenge**: Convert model outputs into actionable scores.
**Deliverables**:

  * Risk probability (0-1)
  * Credit score (300-850 scale)
  * Optimal loan amount and duration recommendations

## 🏛️ Credit Scoring Business Understanding (Task 1 Deliverable)

### Basel II Accord's Influence on Model Interpretability

**Description:** The Basel II Capital Accord mandates that banks using internal models to estimate risk parameters (specifically the Probability of Default - PD) must adhere to strict validation and supervisory oversight requirements. This necessitates that the model is not a 'black box,' but rather is transparent, auditable, and well-documented. An interpretable model is crucial for regulatory compliance, ensuring the bank can provide clear, non-discriminatory reasons for credit decisions to both regulators (Pillar 2: Supervisory Review) and customers.

### Necessity of a Proxy Variable and Business Risks

**Description:** A proxy variable, derived from customer behavioral data (RFM clustering), is essential because the bank lacks historical 'default' labels for this new BNPL product. The proxy ($is\_high\_risk$) serves as the target variable for supervised machine learning, allowing the model to connect eCommerce behavior (low frequency, low monetary value) to an assumed higher financial risk profile.
**Potential Business Risks:**

  * **Credit Loss:** The primary risk is a **False Negative (Type II Error)**, where a truly high-risk customer is labeled low-risk by the proxy, leading to loan approval and subsequent default.
  * **Lost Revenue:** A **False Positive (Type I Error)**, where a creditworthy customer is labeled high-risk, results in unnecessary loan rejection and loss of potential interest income.
  * **Bias and Fairness:** The RFM proxy may inadvertently capture and amplify biases in transactional behavior, leading to unfair or unequal treatment of different customer segments.

### Trade-offs: Simple (Logistic Regression with WoE) vs. Complex (Gradient Boosting) Models

**Description:** The choice of model involves a core trade-off between predictive performance and regulatory compliance/interpretability:

| Model Type | Primary Advantage | Primary Disadvantage | Financial Context Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple (LogReg + WoE)** | **High Interpretability & Auditability.** Easy to generate regulatory-compliant scorecards. | Lower predictive power if relationships are highly non-linear. | Favored for the **official PD model** due to transparency required by regulators. |
| **Complex (Gradient Boosting)** | **Superior Predictive Performance.** Highly effective at capturing complex feature interactions. | **Low Interpretability** (Black Box). Requires post-hoc explainability tools (SHAP/LIME), complicating audit and customer communication. | Used as a **Challenger Model** or for internal strategy optimization, but harder to deploy as the main regulatory tool. |
